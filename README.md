## WordPress Starter Plugin Boilerplate

This is a simple starter plugin boilerplate that includes a base class with a very simple set of utilities that most plugins should have.

## Getting Started

You will need to change the name of the plugin in a few simple steps:

1. Rename the plugin folder name and primary PHP file named 'plugins.php' to your plugin's name
2. Search for `'Starter_Plugin'` and replace with your plugin's proper name with underscores instead of spaces between words.
3. Search for `'starterplugin'` and replace with your desired plugin name in all lowercase with dashes between words (if desired).
4. Search for `'STARTER_PLUGIN'` and replace with your plugin's name in all caps. Spaces should be convered to underscores.
5. Go to `package.json` file and change your settings and check your `Gruntfile.js`.
